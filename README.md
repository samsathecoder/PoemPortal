Poem Portal

This application is designed as a platform where users can globally share their own poems within the portal. Additionally, it features a homepage where all users can view, like, and save the poems shared by others, as well as pages for writing and editing poems, and pages for user sign-in and sign-out processes.

From a technical perspective, the application uses Firebase for user authentication and real-time database operations. It is written in Dart. However, since the project is a personal endeavor, it doesn't strictly adhere to clean code principles, and the backend is somewhat disorganized.
